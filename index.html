<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

<p>I’m a community developer, living in Flint, MI. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I serendipitously fell into the tech world. I was transitioning out of the national political scene and was selected as General Assembly’s World Tour winner a year ago & saw first hand all the amazingly cool things you could do with programming knowledge. Thanks to GA, my world expanded exponentially!</p>

<h2><<strong>My Mission</strong></h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Program Manager with General Assembly in Flint, MI. Yes, I would love to see GA create a Flint hub in the near future because I feel this is a necessary skill for my community to acquire in order to be competitive in a global market.</p>
