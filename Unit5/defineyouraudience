<h1>Step 1: Define Your Audience and Tone</h1>

<h2>Who will visit your site? Potential employers?</h2> 
<p>People around the Flint area who are in the process of creating a startup, launching a startup, or already have a startup. Angel investors will also be visiting the page to look for potential funding opportunities. Also, individuals who are looking for resources from our local service providers.</p>

<h2>New clients or customers?</h2>
<p>No clients, per se. Customers - possible co-working space tenants who will pay a monthly rate or have a season pass.</p>

<h2>What can make you and/or your product stand out against your competitors?</h2>
<p>Since we have had no entrepreneurial ecosystem in the past few decades, we do not have any competitors in our space.</p>

<h2>How would you speak to your clientele if you were communicating in person?</h2>
<p>We would ask where they are at in the planning or their startup, services or needs that they have currently, if they are looking for an angel investor, if they would be interested in working out of a coworking space and we would ask them to join our I and E Meetup group to get plugged in to our growing ecosystem of startups.</p>

<h2>How could you translate that style and tone digitally?</h2>
<p>Creative and lively design. Playful and whimsical.</p>

<h2>What colors represent you or your product?</h2>
<p>Something colorful and creative. We encourage and cultivate ideas.</p>

<h1>Step 2: Indentify Content</h1>

<h2>What images illustrate your message?</h2>
<p>Coworking spaces, startups, product development, and idea creation.</p>

<h2>What are the three-to-five pages titled?</h2>
<p>Flint City Start Up, Entreprenuership & Innovation Meetup Group, and Become an Investor</p>

<h2>What will be the purpose for each?</h2>
<p>Platform for connecting Treps throughout our city to other Treps, service providors, and investors.</p>

<h2>What should each page contain? Will there be textual content? Or just images?</h2>
<p>Mix of both on each page. Content to describe how each group functions and what our group looks like.</p>
